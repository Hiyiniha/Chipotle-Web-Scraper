# Chipotle-Web-Scraper

During the 2023 NBA Finals, Chipotle had a promo called the Free-Pointer. Everytime a three-pointer was made, a code would be sent out on their offcial twitter. This code could be redeemed by be being the first 300 people to send this code to the number 888222. This web scraper looks at Chipotle's most recent tweet, grabs the code, and sends a message to the number. 

In order to use this program, you must run the code on some sort of Mac laptop or computer. This code utilizes iMessage to send the message with the promo code.
